Layer Based Development
I am planning to follow a layer based strategy for game layout.
There will be three main layer in our game .
	TopLayer 
	MiddleLayer 
	BackLayer
	
	BackLayer
BackLayer will consiste of all the static objects which will not interact with user directly. 
This layer  will hold the  background.

	MiddleLayer 
MiddleLayer will consist of all the objects which will move above the Back Layer but won't  interact with user .
This layer will be used for BackGround Animations .

	TopLayer
TopLayer will contain objects like Buttons,which will interact with user directly.
